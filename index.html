          Myself Ashish Prajapati working as Ruby on Rails developer. Having a lot of experience in this area. I believe in following agile methodologies to meet client's expectations. I have worked on so many projects of ror in the team and I am very comfortable to work in the team of developers. I always keep in mind for providing the good product. I am a developer but I also take care of designing at the time of development because it is really important for the good product. I always learn in the team and always discuss the big part of the functionality with the developers and try to make the work perfect. So I am perfect in my job. You and your team will love my work I am sure.

In my 3 years of experience I have developed many websites and applications using latest standards.

I follow all require steps to create scalable application & always follow TDD and BDD standards.

I always follow REStful architecture in development.	

Approach to the Job:
I am not afraid of new technologies and always have a fun while learning it.

I'm a big fan of Agile software development and Test Driven Development(TDD) because it ensures high quality outcome within short time</p>
